So, the first stage of the 5G rollout will naturally take place in high-LSM-income, high-density urban areas. Out in rural areas, where communities are poorer and less densely populated, not too many customers even have the phones to use them, and the investment required will be exponentially more because of the power issues I mentioned above.So not only is the power crisis causing service disruptions across the board, it’s changing the dynamics and threatening the future plans for the vendors currently committing to the 5G rollout in the first place. After all, there are many smart people that for years have been working on the strategy of rolling out national 5G networks, and almost overnight all those calculations are invalidated because they never took into account that we’d have power issues like this.The bottom line, this affects the cost of deployment, which affects ROI, and if ROI isn’t right, deployment can’t happen from a business perspective.I believe that the longer the power crisis continues, the more it will change the way we thought things would happen, development-wise, on expanding and improving 5G network coverage, and getting people connected. Everyone is talking about bridging the digital divide. The problem has never been the lack of internet access, but rather the lack of affordable internet access.Meet the newly appointed minister of electricity, Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa15 hours agoThe perfect storm of a power-crippled 5G rollout will only make things worse and widen rather than narrow that divide.The silver lining, if there is one, is the strong Wireless Internet Service Provider (Wisp) community that has already accounted for and mitigated many of the power issues we’re experiencing today, and as such has a head-start on any 5G deployment in South Africa’s rural and remote areas.Wisps have several advantages over 5G mobile networks when it comes to coverage, speed, cost, reliability, and flexibility of internet access delivery. Ultimately, the choice between WISPs and 5G mobile networks will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the customer or organisation. But with the power crisis potentially putting a spoke in the 5G wheel, the obvious choice for many South Africans may ultimately be made for them.
