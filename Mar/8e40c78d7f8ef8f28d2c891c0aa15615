Whether through creative workshops, encouraging discussions and debates or, simply as a rehearsal space, we would like to invite artists to engage with me and let’s make it magic happen.”The Baxter’s Masambe Theatre is an intimate, fresh space with a seating capacity of 60 and perfect platform for up-and-coming and new theatre-makers to showcase their work.
