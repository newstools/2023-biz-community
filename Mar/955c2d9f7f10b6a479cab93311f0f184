Connecting with the relevant audience and delivering real growth — and measurable growth — is how innovation and excellence intersect," says Nobanda.“It’s creativity that makes a real measurable impact. As more and more marketing budgets move to digital, the challenge of the return on marketing investment (ROMI) becomes even more expected from businesses.“We need to ensure that the entries we ultimately award do not just deliver on ROMI but that they benchmark what is best-in-class for digital advertising,” adds Nobanda, about what she believes jurors will be looking for this year.“Personally, I want to be able to say to myself, ‘Man, I wish we’d done that!" she adds.This year, the Bookmark Awards adds another layer to its offering with a Masterclass to assist entrants to perfect their awards entries.
