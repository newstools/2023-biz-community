While business and commercial banking saw good income growth from commercial banking, higher impairments and rising costs negatively impacted this pillar.During the period, Sasfin achieved a Level 1 B-BBEE contributor rating.Supporting job creationSasfin asset managers announced a partnership with the National Treasury’s jobs fund, enabling it to fund businesses that support job creation.This follows the successful initiative between Sasfin Bank and the Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank which has seen more than R400m in funding provided to youth, women, and Covid-19-affected businesses over the last 24 months.“We have seen exceptional results out of Sasfin Wealth over this period, which continues to grow from strength to strength. While Sasfin Bank has seen strong growth in loans and income largely in asset finance and commercial banking, earnings have been impacted by higher impairments in these areas and the ongoing investment into business banking."We are taking proactive steps to enhance our cost-to-income ratio which should result in improved return on equity in the future,” said Michael Sassoon, group chief executive officer of Sasfin Holdings Limited.
