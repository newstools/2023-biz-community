Delegates will also be part of The Arts Round Table, and artists will get a chance to add an additional show to their trip to South Africa from abroad, said Socika.All Africa Music Award winners announced!23 Jan 2023This year, the key themes are developing independence, building bridges, and amplifying female voices. After last year's success and support from the likes of Mixmag, Music in Africa, Trace TV Southern Africa, and Paradise Worldwide, we look forward to announcing this year's partners soon, as well as the innovative program. This is a conference not to be missed. We are on a mission to build bridges and create real change in the music ecosystem. This year, the NAC supports ARMC to create 150 jobs for South African musicians and executives, enabling knowledge transfer and better preparation for international exchange.Participating in an exchange such as ARMC shows how much value that each of these women selected as part of the ambassador programme bring to the table. We are most certainly excited to keep up with their journeys as they represent their communities.For more, go to http://www.africarisingmusicconference.com/
