But SAB’s Castle Free, in partnership with Shift and Joe Public, is proud to present a brand new innovation to help SA’s binge drinkers pace themselves through these marathon party weekends.Imagine walking into your favourite pub or tavern,only to be confronted with a dazzling set of church-stylestained-glass windows next to the bar.Imagine walking into your favourite pub or tavern, only to be confronted with a dazzling set of church-style stained-glass windows next to the bar. Now imagine your surprise to see this age-old craft, traditionally used to teach moral lessons, exquisitely extolling the virtues of beer.But this is no ordinary brew. With 0.0% alcohol – and therefore 0,0% regret – Castle Free has proclaimed itself SA’s first official guilt-free beer: An equally exquisitely-crafted lager, delivering a premium beer alternative to help transform taverns from veritable dens of regret into phuza-faceless party spots.Each stained-glass window presents a striking illustration of either a Castle Free bottle or glass of beer, featuring its claim to fame: ‘The guilt-free beer’ emblazoned below."The idea behind Castle Free is that people can use it to pace themselves between or after regular alcohol content beers, so they can keep having a good time without the regret that comes from overdoing it," says Wendy Bedforth, Castle Free brand manager at SAB.Vice president of Marketing, Vaughan Croeser, adds: "We always advocate for responsible drinking, and we see our latest project as a bold media innovation that pushes the boundaries of point of purchase advertising in a way that helps people see beer in a new light.""To break through the clutter, we looked for a fresh approach to ambient media that disrupts people’s behaviour," says Simone Rossum, executive creative director at Shift. "The use of stained-glass windows as ‘posters’ aligns to our own purpose of driving a positive impact – by guiding people to better choices, right at the key decision-making moment. By engaging in talks with tavern owners, we hope to install the stained-glass windows either on a temporary or permanent basis, site dependent, in popular pubs across the country."The Shift/Joe Public team, led by Rossum and creative director Christo Krüger, conceptualised and designed the windows, in turn hand-crafted by a team of experts headed by renowned stained-glass artist, Elzabe Heine.In this way, an innovative new communication medium was created to convey an unexpected and attention-grabbing message – ultimately lighting the way for people to enjoy a regret-free weekend with South Africa’s first official guilt-free beer.Cheers to that, we say. As many times as you like.Twitter: @SABreweries | Facebook: @SouthAfricanBreweries | YouTube: SA Breweries @SABLimitedCredits:Brand: AB InBev SAB: Castle FreeVice president: Marketing: Vaughan CroeserBrand manager: Wendy BedforthAgency: SHIFT/Joe PublicGroup chief creative officer: Pepe MaraisChief creative officer: Xolisa DyeshanaExecutive creative director: Simone RossumCreative director: Christo KrügerDesign and production: The Cutting Edge, Elzabe Heine, Rollset CCArt director/designer: Mokoena Kobeli, Nicola SpurdleIllustrator: Mokoena KobeliCreative business director: Amber MackeurtanGroup account director: Jeanne RosenbergConsultant director: Abigail SizaliyoSenior consultant: Neela BambergerAgency producer: Manuel Cardoso Lopes, Belinda Shea, Tammy ChettyCopywriter: Claudette Browne Storrar, Michelle McKenna
