Source: SuppliedThe annual initiative was launched by Food Lover's three years ago, driven by the company's acknowledgment of the need to source local suppliers, specifically small businesses, that have integrated social change into the core of their operations.“We are deeply passionate about our communities, and Seeds of Change is a natural extension of this. We realise that there is a big gap between launching a product and then being able to scale up through the engine of a big retailer like Food Lover’s Market. Seeds of Change connects those dots while enabling us to discover exciting fresh products and services that will delight our customers,” says Terri Coppin-Harris, culture and communication manager for the Food Lover’s Market Group.“This is an opportunity to create employment and make a social impact across South Africa. We are looking for suppliers that mirror these socially focused values, are passionate about retail and are motivated to deliver the best quality product or service.”As an emerging sector, social enterprises work to solve many of the prevalent social and environmental problems in South Africa while contributing to economic growth and job creation. Unfortunately, this sector is still not prioritised as a key driver in the South African economy, notes Food Lover's, which aims to challenge this mindset by presenting a unique opportunity for social enterprises to become part of the corporate supply chain.Local tea brand crowned Food Lover's Market's new social enterprise supplier17 May 2022Top 10 bootcampApplications to the Seeds of Change Supplier Development Partnership open on 13 March 2023 and close on 17 April 2023.
