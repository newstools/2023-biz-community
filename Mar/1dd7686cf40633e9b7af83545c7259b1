This is relevant as the rural cost of living is lower than the urban cost of living, so it may well be prudent to give agriculture its own minimum wage determination. Kwanalu prior to the announcement, recommended that an increase of less than CPI is more realistic of the industry position and the impacts on the livelihoods of rural employees and dwellers. We will continue to explore options to address the high increase and its impacts," says La Marque.
