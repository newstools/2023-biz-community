My call, however, is that as we consume this technology and embrace it, we do so with humanity in mind."Source: SuppliedMpedi said the university is cognisant of the possibilities the technological shift brings, but that advancement and technology are inextricably linked."We must find empowerment in advancement and use these tools to create more sustainable frameworks. This, I would argue, is the real future of the 4IR," he said.Bridging industry and academiaUJ's partnership with Schneider Electric began in 2016 with the goal of bridging the gap between industry and academia, explained Zanelle Dalglish, global leader: training and education affairs at Schneider Electric. Through the partnership, students are readied to take up the challenge as they enter the workforce, trained in advanced technologies already being applied in industry."The beauty in our partnership really is that Schneider Electric is a global energy management specialist, and we have fantastic technology, but this technology only comes to life when we install it into communities and into society where it's really utilised and people are benefiting from it," she said.
