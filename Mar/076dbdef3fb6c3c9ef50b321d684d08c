The Fame Film Shorts Festival takes place from 7-9 September 2023 at The Labia Theatre in Cape Town and will showcase cinematic magic that will inspire not only the judges, but the broader cinema-loving public who are seeking alternatives to major studio projects.“Film shorts are exciting because they have to tell a compelling story or convey a powerful message in a limited amount of time. This can lead to creative and innovative approaches to storytelling, such as unique visual styles or unconventional narratives. Additionally, the shorter format can allow for more experimentation and risk-taking, as filmmakers may have more freedom to explore unconventional ideas that might not work in a longer format,” says Martin Hiller, portfolio director of Fame Week Africa.Call for entriesJudges will be selecting films from seven categories:Best Narrative Short Film	Best Documentary Short Film	Best Animated Short Film	Best Experimental Short Film	Best Student Short Film	Best I&D Short Film	Best Music VideoFame Film Festival has teamed up with FilmFreeway to ensure a seamless entry process.
