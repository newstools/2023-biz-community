Through this funding, FALF was able to empower five black women researchers in two institutions, namely, Wits University and University of Johannesburg. Conducting this research helps with their own development while also coming up with solutions to a scourge that is affecting all communities in South Africa. The partnership between FALF and Massmart is a good example of a multisectoral collaboration to develop women while also helping them to find evidence-based solutions to local challenges.”
