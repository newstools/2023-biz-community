Fourteen of these have achieved the elite international Certified Professional Speaker (CSP) accreditation.Three are Global Speaking Fellows, having achieved their CSP and spoken at a significant number of events in different regions of the world. These veterans demonstrate – and generously share – business acumen, specialised knowledge, and their mastery of key competencies unique to global markets.“Southern Africa’s professional speaking industry is comparatively small, but there are significant opportunities for growth and development, particularly as the region continues to embrace emerging technologies and adapt to changing circumstances,” adds Tsitsi Mutendi, PSASA’S deputy president.The 14 March is also known as "Pi Day” because of its 3.14 numerical representation. What is the connection between pi and professional speakers? Cavett Robert, co-founder of the National Speakers Association (NSA), explains: “Don’t worry about how we [professional speakers] divide up the pie. There is enough for everybody. Let’s just make a bigger pie!"
