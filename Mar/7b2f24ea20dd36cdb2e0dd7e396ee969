Most of the tattooers will have space to tattoo you. However, if you have your heart dead set and want to be sure your favourite artist will have time, you can pre-book by contacting them directly via Artist Page which you can. The best time to pre-book is from around a month before the event.DatesJohannesburgDate: 24 - 26 March 2023Venue: 1FOX, Newtown, JohannesburgPrice: R235 - R620Tickets: Webtickets | https://bit.ly/SAITC2023JHBCape TownDate: 31 March - 1 April 2023Venue: The Lookout, V&A Waterfront, Cape TownPrice: R235 - R620Tickets: Webtickets | https://bit.ly/SAITC2023CTFor more, go to https://www.southafricantattooconvention.comFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SATattooConventionInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SA_TattooConvention
