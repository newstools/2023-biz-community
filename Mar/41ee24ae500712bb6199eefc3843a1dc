Seacom is blessed with great talent and a very experienced leadership team, who will provide both the continuity and expertise required to ensure we remain a leader on the continent as the company continues to transform and expand,” Fortuin said.During Fortuin’s tenure, he drove the company’s ambitious five-year strategy to become a Pan-African converged telecommunications organisation.Based on this, Seacom has diversified its offerings in both the wholesale and enterprise segments, as well as entering new key markets and broadening its geographic footprint.Seacom has also completed several major acquisitions under Fortuin’s guidance. These include the acquisition of ICT service provider EOH Networking Solutions (EOH-NS) and Hymax, as well as the purchase of selected infrastructure assets in Kenya and Uganda.“The last few years have been a period of change and growth for Seacom. It has been thanks to effective leadership that we have weathered storms, made bold decisions, and redefined how we do business across the continent. We are grateful to Oliver for his commitment to our shared vision and wish him all the best,” said Pieter Uys, chairman of the Seacom board.
