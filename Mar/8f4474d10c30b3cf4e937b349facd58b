Theatre-makers showed great resilience in yet another difficult year of producing and mounting outstanding work.“The industry is grateful to the public for supporting the arts, returning to theatres in their droves, hungry for a live theatre experience.“These shows helped us to experience deep-seated emotions and change our perceptions of the world, as well as better understand the struggles and successes of other people and cultures. They reminded us that we are not alone. With these nominations, we celebrate and honour the sterling work showcased.”Melane explains that in the category for Musicals and Music Theatre productions, there will only be awards for Best Performance by an Actress and Best Performance by an Actor. This is attributed to the limited number of musicals and music theatre productions that were staged.Tracey Saunders, overseeing the evaluation of all student productions for awards, says: “It’s been a delight to watch students return to full-time study on campus after the Covid-enforced break. Their enthusiasm shone through on stages at all of the tertiary institutions.Joburg Film Festival and MultiChoice Group cement their commitment to building filmmakersIssued by  MultiChoice 17 Jan 2023“Students staged 70 productions ranging from a few large-cast extravaganzas to small, intimate pieces and several in between. Increasingly, students venture beyond acting to hone their talents in writing, directing and the technical craft required to stage work. These multi-talented and disciplined young people, 185 of them to be precise, were the focus of much deliberation. Ten nominees have deservedly earned their places on this list. With a cohort of such disciplined and talented students, the future of the creative industry in South Africa looks bright.”The student institutions represented are Act (Cape Town), AFDA, CTDPS, LAMTA, Magnet Theatre, Northlink College, University of Stellenbosch and the Waterfront Theatre School.And the nominees are...Award for Most Promising StudentAnna Olivier | LAMTABuhle Stefane | Magnet TheatreGerard van Rooyen |LAMTAKatherine Sharp | AFDAKetsia Velaphi | AFDAKoketso Mere | Waterfront Theatre SchoolMiché C van Wyk | University of StellenboschMikayla Joy Brown | University of StellenboschMinke Marais | University of StellenboschSunny Yoon | LAMTABest New South African ScriptBasil Appollis and Sylvia Vollenhoven | Dance of the La GumasFred Abrahamse and Marcel Meyer | Contested BodiesNadia Davids | Hold StillNico Scheepers | Nêrens, Noord-KaapScott Sparrow | Dinner at the 42sBest New DirectorCarlo Daniels | No Complaints – New Day, New DawnDuane Alexander | Your Song – The Music of Elton JohnEmma Amber | The Marvelous WonderettesIman Isaacs | IrmaSohail Booise | Hostel Lights (Zabalaza Best of the Fest)Best Theatre Production for Children and Young PeopleLiewe Heksie en die rolskaatse | Margit Meyer-RödenbeckPeter Pan | A&M Productions (Fred Abrahamse and Marcel Meyer)Sonde met die spoke | University of Stellenbosch Drama DepartmentVlooi en die geheim/Kipper and the Secret | Marinda Engelbrecht and Margit Meyer-RödenbeckBest Performance by an EnsembleAlbert Pretorius, De Klerk Oelofse and Geon Nel | Nêrens, Noord-Kaap | Ronnie, Andries and FransAndrew Buckland, Billy Langa, Carlo Daniels, Craig Leo, Faniswa Yisa, Marty Kintu, Nolufefe Ntshuntshe, Sandra Prinsloo and Roshina Ratnam | Life and Times of Michael K | Various rolesBrendan van Rhyn, Christopher Dudgeon and Rudi Jansen | The Triplets of Bellville | Cathy Specific, Holly and MollyDean Balie, Grant van Ster and Shaun Oelf | Karatara | ThemselvesLungile Lallie, Marcel Meyer and Matthew Baldwin | Contested Bodies | John Nobody, Doctor James Barry and Lord Charles SomersetBest Performance in a Revue, Cabaret or One-person ShowDaniel Anderson | Vincent – His Quest to Love and Be Loved | Various rolesDaniel Newton | Shadow Boxing | FlynnErika Marais | Die Goeie Pa | Various rolesSibuyiselo Dywili | The House of Truth | Can ThembaSophie Joans | Île | HerselfBest Performance by an Actor in a Musical of Music TheatreAnzio September | Aunty Merle: Things Get Real | ZaneEarl Gregory | Star+Crossed | BillyLoukmaan Adams | Aunty Merle: Things Get Real | BennyMarc Lottering | Aunty Merle: Things Get Real | Aunty MerleShaun Oelf | Aunty Merle: Things Get Real | Lead DancerBest Performance by an Actress in a Musical of Music TheatreJawaahier Petersen | Aunty Merle: Things Get Real | SorayaKeiko Mdwaba | Once on this Island | Little Ti Moune/PeasantNoluthando Dlamini | The Marvelous Wonderettes | Betty JeanSarah Jane | Star+Crossed | BessTankiso Mamabolo | Aunty Merle: Things Get Real | Ayanda/Dr McTavishBest Puppetry DesignAdrian Kohler | Handspring Puppet Company | Life and Times of Michael KBest Lighting DesignFaheem Bardien | Star+CrossedGideon Lombard | KarataraJoshua Cutts | Life and Times of Michael KMannie Manim | Kiss of the Spider WomanWolf Britz | FireflyBest Set DesignGreg King | Fordsburg’s FinestNial Griffin | Dinner with the 42sPatrick Curtis | Hold StillThemba Stewart | No Complaints – New Day, New DawnWolf Britz | Kiss of the Spider WomanBest Costume DesignBrendan van Rhyn, Christopher Dudgeon and Rudi Jansen | The Triplets of BellvilleMarcel Meyer | A Streetcar Named DesireMarcel Meyer | Contested BodiesNial Griffin | Dinner with the 42sPhillis Midlane | Life and Times of Michael KBest Sound Design, Original Music or Live PerformanceGideon Lombard | Karatara | Sound designCharl-Johan Lingenfelder | A Streetcar Named Desire | Sound designKyle Shephard | Life and Times of Michael K | Original musicSimon Kohler | Life and Times of Michael K | Sound designWessel Odendaal | Star+Crossed | Original musicBest Performance in an Opera – MaleConroy Scott | Le Nozze di Figaro | FigaroLwazi Dlamini | Le Nozze di Figaro | BartoloSmelo Mahlangu | Sara Baartman – The Opera | Georges CuvierVan Wyk Venter | L’elisir d’amore | BelcoreWilliam Berger | Le Nozze di Figaro | Count AlmavivaBest Performance in an Opera – FemaleBongiwe Nakani | Sara Baartman – The Opera | Sara BaartmanBrittany Smith | Le Nozze di Figaro | SusannaMegan Kahts | Alcina | RuggieroSetsoane Jeannette Ntseki | Alcina | MorganaSiphamandla Moyake | Le Nozze di Figaro | Countess AlmavivaBest Performance by a Supporting Actor in a PlayBrent Palmer | Dinner at the 42s | DrinkwaterCarlo Daniels | The Unlikely Secret Agent | Various rolesGerard Rudolf | Neon Smoel | The Lobster ManMatthew Baldwin | A Streetcar Named Desire | MitchSanda Shandu | Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf | NickBest Performance by a Supporting Actress in a PlayBabalwa Makwetu | IKrele leChiza...
