The impact of the EU [European Union] sanctions on diesel imports from Russia was already priced in.“The LPGas prices increased due to higher freight rate and Propane and Butane prices during the same period. These factors led to higher contributions to the Basic Fuel Prices of petrol by 73.89 c/l and lower contributions to the BFP of diesel and illuminating paraffin by 26.48 c/l and 40.90 c/l, respectively,” the department said.The Rand’s weak output against the US dollar (USD) also contributed to the increases.“The Rand depreciated, on average, against the US dollar from R17.05 to R17.74 per USD during the period under review when compared to the previous one. This led to higher contributions to the Basic Fuel Prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 48.26 c/l, 52.53 c/l and 53.56 c/l respectively,” the department said.
