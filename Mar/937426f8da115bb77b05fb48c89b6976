It has also become a crucial tool for agencies in recruiting top young talent, providing a platform for recognition from local industry peers, and giving agencies a place on the global stage as the ad world tunes in to this one-of-a-kind event.The programme includes Portfolio Night All-Stars, a weeklong virtual program where each city host selects one young creative in their market with the best portfolio to participate. These lucky All-Stars will work in teams on a brief from a major global brand sponsor to be determined, and attend seminars and recruiting sessions.At the end of the week, each team presents their pitch, with the winning team being flown to New York by The One Club for a week of events and networking opportunities.“Portfolio Night is a unique global event that serves as a high-visibility opportunity for agencies and creative professionals to give back to the industry by guiding the earliest steps of future copywriters, art directors and technologists,” says Kevin Swanepoel, CEO, The One Club for Creativity.“We’re very grateful for the agencies and organisations who have signed on to make this important global event possible in their markets, and look forward to additional hosts getting involved.”Branding for Portfolio Night 2023 was created by Nana Rausch at Quick Honey, based in New York and Berlin
