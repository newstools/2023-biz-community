Whereas the company started out with a staff complement of six, it now has more than 1,000 staff dedicated to delivering its promise of ‘making the loss of a loved one easier’.Capital Legacy’s success is owed to pioneering an insurance product called the Legacy Protection Plan™, wherein for a premium of less than R200 per month, a client can have their estate wound up with no executor, trustee, or conveyance fees, saving up to millions of rands for beneficiaries. This is all made possible by the fact that Capital Legacy does not outsource its estates and trusts operations but rather has built its own, and integrated these services into the Legacy Protection Plan™.Quick links:Website: www.capitallegacy.co.zaFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CapitalLegacyLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/capital-legacyInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/capital.legacyTwitter: https://twitter.com/CapitalLegacyYouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/CapitalLegacySouthAfrica
