Our flavours are rooted in cultural influences, pivoting legacy favourites amongst South Africans; Chakalaka, Masala and the classic Chilli, into enjoyable snacks.”PepsiCo South Africa is innovating in ways that snack brands can fit into consumers culture and lifestyle. The three flavours are suitable for unique and personal taste preferences.Robot Boii & Mpho PoppsTo celebrate and engage consumers on the Flamin’ Hot Range, a campaign was rolled out driving a simple flavour message through “Unleash Your Heat” tag line, across key and relevant consumer touch points.
