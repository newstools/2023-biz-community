Each year the Nedbank IMC develops a theme reflective of marketing’s current concerns and conversations. This year’s theme Up close and personal has a dual meaning. Following the Nedbank IMC’s in-person hiatus, it’s time to get together once again, reconnect and forge new connections.It is also a time for marketing to get to know and understand customers better. Dale Hefer, CEO of Nedbank IMC says that as today’s customers continue to grow in sophistication and complexity, not knowing our customers can have a material impact on brands. According to global research company Euromonitor, 30% of Gen Z consumers, in particular, make purchase decisions based on brands' social and political beliefs, while 24% boycott brands that don’t share their social or political beliefs. Dale says: “As marketers and advertisers it’s imperative that we dial in to our customers to gain deeper levels of understanding so that we can reflect our customers’ core values back at them in all that we do.”This year Nedbank IMC delegates can expect the same winning one day, one stage, no less than 18 speakers formula. For those familiar with Nedbank IMC, they will – quite rightly – anticipate the high energy and pacy line-up of local and international thought leaders which exemplifies the conference.For those yet to attend, Nedbank IMC is not only a knowledge-sharing platform in which to hear first-hand from some of Africa and the world’s leading marketing voices; it is a master class in a conference approach.
