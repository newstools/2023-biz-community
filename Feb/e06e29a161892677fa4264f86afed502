Formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of GDP in emerging markets and provide 70% of jobs.




A local report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC)  indicates that SMEs make up more than 90% of all formal business in the country, employ 50–60% of the workforce and contribute 34% of GDP.“It’s evident from these indicators that, if we want to make a positive and sustainable impact on the challenges of unemployment and on the muted economic growth and quality of life in South Africa, we have to focus on growing, nurturing, and supporting our SMEs,” says Andrew Moodley, chief digital and marketing officer at Axiz.Whether a business focuses on reselling technology, solutions development, or systems integration and implementation, the Axiz SME C2C Program invite SMEs to register to participate in future events.As the leading technology distributor in Africa, with a presence in over 15 countries, Axiz applies its insight and more than three decades of industry know-how to bring vendors and partners together and to drive business growth.
