"Interest costs should come down and that should make Eskom a viable ... going concern."The Treasury said that it would settle R184bn that Eskom owes over the next three years via a loan that converts to equity in the utility and then take on R70bn of debt directly in the 2025/26 financial year.Phased approachThe phased approach speaks to the government's fiscal caution, "which is positive for investor confidence", said Khanyisa Phika, an economist at Alexforbes, a South African financial services firm that holds Eskom debt.




"We are certain that government is actually serious about turning around Eskom," she added."It's highly likely that it's credit positive for Eskom and credit-neutral for the sovereign," Jones Gondo, an analyst at Nedbank, said of the plan."If they don't meet the conditions of operational performance, then the loans they're getting from the government don't convert into equity and that slows down the credit trajectory."#Budget2023: Fresh billions in debt relief for Eskom announcedBy Katja Hamilton 14 hours agoNo more bailouts after this one, says GodongwanaGodongwana told Reuters that there would be no more bailouts for Eskom after this one, adding that if it failed to comply with the debt relief conditions then "heads must roll".These conditions include using the debt relief to only settle debt and interest payments and requiring Eskom to prioritise maintenance of its dilapidated coal power stations and capital expenditure on transmission and distribution.But some investors said more clarity was required on these conditions and their enforcement."Other than withholding subsequent relief payments, there is no indication of other steps Treasury will take to assist the utility to return to sustainability," said Raphi Rootshtain, a portfolio manager at South African financial services firm Sasfin Wealth.
