Planet42 buys the customer’s chosen car and rents it out to them on a subscription basis.Grant Wing, South Africa managing director and country manager of Planet42, says:Planet42 is committed to breaking down the barriers that South Africans face in accessing cars. The struggle for credit, particularly for car finance, has been an ongoing challenge for millions of people in the country, even a decade ago, when the economy was arguably in better shape, and we understand the significant impact that this has on people’s lives. Essentially, no car equals lower standards of living and, in many cases, no income at all. Our mission is to empower people to create a brighter future for themselves, and we are proud to be a part of their journey towards financial inclusion and success.#StartupStory: Planet42 aims to solve 'transport inequality'By Evan-Lee Courie 11 Mar 2021“I’m thrilled to support Planet42 as they expand worldwide and improve the lives of thousands of individuals who face limited access to private transportation, which can significantly impact their quality of life and opportunities.
