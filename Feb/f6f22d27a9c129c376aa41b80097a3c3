The businessman's lawyer declined to respond to the allegation, saying they will wait for the charges.Journalist killings up by 50% in 2022By Karabo Ledwaba 18 Jan 2023The RSF report said over a dozen members of Cameroon's intelligence service had been detained, including its senior leadership, one of whom provided the written confession.Spokespeople for Cameroon's government and the intelligence service could not be reached for comments on Monday.Zogo's killing was the latest in a string of attacks against journalists in Cameroon, which has a vibrant press but where President Paul Biya has a decades-long record of repressing opposition.The media watchdog Committee to Protect Journalists on Thursday urged Cameroon authorities to be transparent over Zogo, and also account for the death of another journalist in government custody in 2019.
