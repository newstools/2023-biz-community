With two unfortunate events that our initial launch in 2019; the biggest one being the Covid-19 pandemic, I’d say that we’ve overcome the biggest challenge,” says Motshegwa.He says the biggest challenges during the week is navigating all the moving parts but with the support of the Advertising Week brand as well as Brand Reserve he believes it will go off without any significant problems.He adds: “This is a huge event with a lot of moving parts and as such, coordinating and ensuring that everybody is on the same page was also a huge challenge, but it comes with the territory. Looking back, every emotion felt during this process was worth it, because whichever way you look at it, we’ve made history.”Motshegwa says they hope the event will help them contribute meaningfully to the industry.“If the industry is not protected, there’s truly nothing left for us. Additionally, we want to help scale Africa’s talent and global influence to the rest of the world. We want to leave the industry, women and the continent better than we found it,” he says.
