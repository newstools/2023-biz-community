The Dunlop Westville tyre centre aims to deliver technical, training and retail expertise to industryThis new venture sees the iconic tyre brand combining its technical and training expertise with a digitally powered retail environment to deliver a high-end offering to the discerning local customer.But it’s not all just rubber and shine – behind the storefront lies a state-of-the-art technical centre, with Dunlop-trained experts, through which Dunlop aims to inform, educate and set a new benchmark for customer experience in the tyre fitment field going forward.Raising the barMatthew Trinder, divisional head: Retail at Sumitomo Rubber South Africa, which manufactures the Dunlop brand, said in order to keep ahead in an evolving and competitive market, there was a need to adopt a unique approach.“The Dunlop Westville store is a novel concept that not only establishes one of the first corporate retail offerings from any South African tyre manufacturer, but also combines this with a technical and training expertise hub to serve the wider industry. Our aim is to showcase what best-in-class looks and feels like when it comes to tyre fitment and retail, where the overall experience of today’s technologically savvy, convenience-seeking customer is paramount,” said Trinder.The retail store is housed within a light steel frame structure that somewhat masks the true offering inside. Clients can enjoy a fully equipped coffee shop, with WiFi, charging stations, and booths to work or eat while they wait. There is also a KidsZone with kiddies’ library and dedicated KidsTV to keep little ones happy. The store provides an immersive digital experience, with in-store digital touchpoints including large electronic screens in the workshop area, charging stations to power up any personal devices, and tablets available to order refreshments from nearby restaurants. A Dunlop history wall ensures that when customers walk into the store, they get a real sense of the rich heritage of the Dunlop brand.Dunlop Westville tyre centre clients can enjoy a fully equipped coffee shop, with WiFi, charging stations, and booths to work or eat while they wait.
