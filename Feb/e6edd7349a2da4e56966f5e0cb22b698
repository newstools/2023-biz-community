It’s an inspirational shot in the arm for the power of design.RX Africa states that the Cape and Joburg Decor & Design Weeks will catapult the crucially untapped resource of creativity and design in paving the way to a better future for all, and while it does so, provide everyone who participates and visits a much-needed opportunity to connect, converse, create and enjoy themselves.Dates to diarise19 – 25 June 2023: Cape Decor & Design Week22 – 25 June 2023: Decorex Cape Town and 100% Design Africa at the Cape Town International Convention Centre31 July – 6 August 2023: Joburg Decor & Design Week3 August – 6 August 2023: Decorex Joburg, Design Joburg and 100% Design Africa at Sandton Convention Centre
