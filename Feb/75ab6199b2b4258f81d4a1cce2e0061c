Accordingly, open-banking vendors must educate consumers, and provide greater transparency surrounding data privacy and security by highlighting the procedures in place to protect financial data to ease security concerns and encourage greater adoption of open-banking services when marketing their solutions.”New use cases to drive open banking growthThe research also predicts the development of new use cases will be instrumental to ensuring that open banking fulfils its potential. One of the most promising new use cases is the ability to use open banking payments to pay tax bills, as introduced in the UK. As bill payments using open banking expand outside of the UK, they are expected to account for more than $59bn globally in transaction values by 2027.




Vendors in the open banking space must continue to invest in new high-potential open banking use cases, such as full integration within e-commerce marketplaces. This will help both further develop the open-banking market and attract a more sizeable user base; becoming more competitive in an increasingly saturated digital payments market.
