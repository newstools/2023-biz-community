Unsurprisingly, South African brands are also seeking to get into podcasting, and one recurring theme I find in discussions with clients (of all sizes) is that it’s an attractive option because of its perceived low barrier to entry. It is indeed one of the medium’s best attributes - and its worst.At its most basic, all a podcast requires to get off the ground (besides enough motivation and a data connection) is an idea for content and some way to record it - a laptop or mobile phone will do.We’re even at the point now where AI services will take care of things like show notes and social media posts to promote your new podcast.
