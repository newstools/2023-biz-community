How will increase decisions be impacted by the current economic climate?"First, we need to ascertain what is meant by 'current economic climate'," says Bussin. He highlights the following key factors that define the country's economic situation and impede employers' ability to make favourable increase decisions: Pedestrian economic growth; Despairing energy supply; Zero investment confidence; High inflation; Dismal service delivery at all levels of government – local, provincial and national; and No political will from government.Salary survey: Sad wage increases mean retention strategies need to get creative27 May 2022What is the impact of these factors on employers' ability to make increase decisions?These economic failings will inevitably cause employers to: Be more cautious and prioritise corporate budget stability over employee rewards; Face decreased revenues, causing them to delay or reduce salary increases to mitigate financial strain; Give more consideration to the current unemployment rate and market competition for labour when making decisions on salary increases; Hold back on incentive and bonus payouts, and strengthen the link between these payouts and company performance; Adjust the amount and frequency of payouts based on the company's financial performance; and Possibly opt to reduce or eliminate bonus and incentive payouts altogether to reduce costs, save money and maintain financial stability.What needs to happen for this situation to improve?"You can ask a thousand economists this question and you will get a thousand different answers," says Bussin. However, from a company perspective, relative to the decisions around making salary increases possible, he believes the following must happen at all levels of government: Eliminate corruption; Streamline regulations and reduce red tape; Overhaul the education system entirely; Encourage entrepreneurship; Address the inequality gap; Promote exports and support SMMEs; and Manage government debt and implement fiscal discipline to help restore investor confidence.How to successfully negotiate a salary increase in 202315 Dec 2022What does this mean for employees?"Until the government takes decisive and proactive steps to remove these economic barriers, organisations will be unable to respond positively to their employees' cost-of-living requirements," says Bussin.He encourages companies and concern groups to continue to put pressure on the nation's leaders to make tangible reforms that will help South Africa recover from crippling economic deficiencies."We can talk about working together towards a solution all we want. But, if the proper political, legal and socio-economic foundations are not in place, there is no footing to climb out of the hole in which we collectively find ourselves," he says.
