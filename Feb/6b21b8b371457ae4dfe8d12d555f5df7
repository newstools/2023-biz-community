"There are short-term solutions to alleviate some stages of load shedding, but the only long-term solution is new generation," said Peter Venn, chief executive officer of Seriti's renewable energy subsidiary Seriti Green.The R4bn wind farm will be the first step in 900MW of renewable energy projects planned by Seriti, saying these will help ease rolling power cuts in Africa's most advanced economy.Omnia, WKN Windcurrent sign MoU to evaluate green ammonia production at Sasolburg plantBy Sindy Peters 1 day agoWind farm operational from 2025Seriti last August launched its foray into renewable energy with the acquisition of Windlab Africa's wind and solar energy assets.Seriti Resources chief executive Mike Teke said the wind farm is expected to feed power into the national grid from 2025."We felt that it's important that we take our responsibility and consider investing in renewable energy because we believe climate change is reality, we believe carbon neutrality is important and we have to make sure that we participate," said Teke.Sasol last month announced it had signed three 229MW wind power purchase deals as it shifts towards renewable energy to meet its carbon emissions targets.
