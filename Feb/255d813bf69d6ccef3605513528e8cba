Being a truly global business now, the relative importance of our key regions has grown and that is why we redefined our executive structure to give our regions more support and influence across the business. We also have worked hard to consolidate our portfolio, bringing the best of all acquired agencies together for more client impact.”InSites Consulting realized total revenues of $115m in 2022, representing a double-digit growth versus the year before, with almost half realised in EMEA, about one-third in the USA, and one-fifth in APAC.

Focusing on consumer insight in South Africa for the last 12 years has been enriching for me as it becomes a personal endeavor to help brands succeed. However, by collaborating with colleagues in Europe and the Middle East, I can already anticipate what’s next for our market, and what new technologies and methodologies can truly make an impact here, and I’m excited to share those with our clients.”
