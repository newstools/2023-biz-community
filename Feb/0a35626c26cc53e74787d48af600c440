Source: MSN  MSN The ABC Q4 2022 is outHowever, in particular, consumer magazines and free magazines have not yet found their feet, with the two sectors mainly showing declines in Q4, 2022 on Q3, 2022 as well as the number of publications changing sector, resigning or no issue.In a statement the ABC has also noted the growth of digital magazines. “In general, digital growth is drastic across the board as many publishers opt for hybrid or digital-only publications. The true impact of digital-only remains to be seen."It adds that digital publications have increased from 333,068 (Q3, 2022) to 382,135 (Q4, 2022).Consumer MagazinesOf the 17 sectors the Business and News sector fared the best in terms of number of publications that increased on the previous quarter, with the Family Interest sector faring that worst with no increases on the previous quarter. The same can be said for the Home sector, except for Lose It and The Gardener/Die Tuinier which both showed increases on the previous quarter with the Gardener/Die Tuinier also showing an increase on the prior year.




The Male and Women’s General sectors continued to decline except for Rooi Rose (a new member) and Women and Home. In the Male sector the two publications both did, however, have an increase on the prior year.The only two publications in the Youth sector have both resigned.Arts, Culture and HeritagePublicationFrequencyFree circulationTotal circulation% change quarter% change yearJewish LifeMtly8,4358,435-2.9%3.9%Val de Vie Magazine2xA0No IssueBusiness and NewsBusiness BriefAltM0Changed SectorFinancial MailWkly, Fr2,65912,0661.0%-5.4%Forbes AfricaAltM3,8929,2160.9%-10.6%SA Real Estate Investor MagazineMtly0Changed SectorThe Big Issue MagazineMtly797,41521.7%3.9%Conservation and WildlifeAfrican BirdlifeAltM5376,303-2.0%3.6%EntertainmentTV Plus (Afrikaans)F011,555-1.6%-12.3%TV Plus (English)F02,3232.1%-32.5%Family InterestHuisgenootWkly, Th4,571105,296-7.8%-18.9%LIG11xA86014,988-2.8%-14.6%Plus 50 6xA2,1405,309-9.7%-8.2%Spot-On (Formerly known as Spotong)AltM0No IssueChanged SectorThe Crest7xA10,28910,289-1.6%-19.4%The Ridge8xA12,21712,217-0.1%-24.2%YouWkly, Th3,62653,963-8.1%-21.7%FarmingFarmer's WeeklyWkly, Fr4706,415-5.1%-10.4%Grond tot MondQ0No IssueLandbouweekbladWkly, Th011,1621.2%-11.1%Marktoe!Mtly12,79212,792-5.9%19.7%Veeplaas.11xA0Changed SectorHealth & WellbeingGrow to Eat3xA2,44111,731Reporting Change5.6%Odyssey Magazine.Q0ResignedHomeConde Nast House & GardenMtly4,94011,821-1.5%-0.9%Easy DIYQ03,520-26.3%-43.5%Food&Home MagazineQ2,02513,348New MemberLose It,Q09,61813.6%-12.6%SA Home Owner11xA3,63617,061-12.9%-24.3%Sarie Kos / FoodQ013,218-13.3%-29.7%The Gardener / Die TuinierMtly10,34525,8082.3%15.1%Tuis Home8xA1,71362,379-6.5%-14.7%Visi6xA1,55510,279-25.0%-14.6%LeisureLet’s Braai / Kom ons Braai (former The Ultimate Braai)Ann10,27020,718Reporting ChangeLife & Style.4xA4,8004,800New MemberSilver Digest 4xA0No IssueMaleGQ5xA2,8804,928-9.5%0.2%Popular MechanicsMtly3,44913,164-2.5%8.4%Very Interesting (former Braintainment)AltM0ResignedMotoringBike SAMtly0Publication ClosedCarMtly16,23341,097-2.4%-4.6%Driven MagazineMtly7,7177,7175.8%-45.3%ParentingBaba & KleuterQ0No IssueBaby's and BeyondQ7,4379,501-8.7%3.8%Things to do With Kids2xA8,0198,019New MemberYour Pregnancy and BabyAltM1,6296,1024.6%-13.3%PetsAnimaltalkMtly0ResignedSport and HobbyCompleat GolferMtly5,2478,2718.8%32.1%Kick OffMtly0DiscontinuedMagnum8xA09,758-12.1%-13.1%SA RugbyMtly1,89910,1701.0%-23.3%Travel, Tourism & HospitalityCape Etc3xA4,1236,627No Issue-5.9%GetawayMtly5,39515,138-2.9%-6.8%go!
