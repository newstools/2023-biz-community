While the full-year 2022, and particularly the fourth quarter, represented a challenging moment for Hasbro, we are confident in our Blueprint 2.0 strategy, unveiled in October, which includes a focus on fewer, bigger brands; gaming; digital; and our rapidly growing direct to consumer and licensing businesses."GLOBALToy and entertainment giant Hasbro names Chris Cocks as CEO10 Jan 2022Cocks continued, "Through this strategy, we are putting the consumer at the centre of everything we do, and our operational excellence programme is on track to drive significant cost savings across the business and improve our overall competitiveness. These strategic pillars helped to improve our results, particularly operating profit margin and revenue growth in key categories, in a challenging fourth quarter, and lay the groundwork for continued progress in 2023."As part of these organisational and commercial changes, Eric Nyman, president and chief operating officer, is departing Hasbro.
