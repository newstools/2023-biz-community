We would like to increase this number to 100% by giving our retailers the option to tap into a cheaper, more sustainable and clean form of backup power than the currently widely used diesel-powered generators,” said Itumeleng Mothibeli, MD SA at Vukile.Growthpoint powers SA business through load sheddingIssued by  Catchwords 10 Feb 2023Generators come with high fuel costsItumeleng Mothibeli, MD South Africa, Vukile Property FundVukile’s research shows that while diesel-driven generators have been a suitable solution for lower levels of load shedding in the past – and continue to be so in certain cases – in continuous Stage 3 or higher load shedding, the financial cost of current backup solutions makes them no longer feasible in most cases.They carry unsustainably high fuel costs, substantial maintenance costs and contribute to carbon and noise pollution. On average, total electricity costs for tenants increased by between 25% to 30% based on having to run generators at R8-10/kWh during load shedding over the period January to October 2022.Vukile’s new hybrid solar-battery, grid-tied system will give shopping centres at least three sources of power – solar PV, battery backup and the national grid. It says that these silent systems are easy to integrate into malls’ existing power networks, need little maintenance and are simple to expand.Retailers have the option to augment this further with generators for days when solar generation is constrained.The first phase of the project is scheduled for completion by the end of 2023.
