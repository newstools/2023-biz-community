But what does this phenomenon say about our society and our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)?Firstly, marketing backlash reflects the larger societal issues around DEI. As our society becomes more diverse, its crucial for marketers and advertisers to be aware of the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of their audience. Unfortunately, many brands continue to miss the mark and create messaging that is insensitive, divisive, or outright offensive.Assuming society is overly sensitive is not the solution.

This is not only unacceptable, but it also perpetuates a culture of exclusion and discrimination.Is consumer backlash affecting ad creativity?By Sid Peimer 1 day agoMarketers and advertisers speak to a vast audience, and its possible to create messaging that is inclusive, respectful, and engaging to a diverse audience.
