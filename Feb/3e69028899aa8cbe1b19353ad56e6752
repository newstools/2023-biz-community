Gallagher Convention Centre offers exceptional space with flexible options and an emphasis on long-term relationships,” says Philip Woods, events director: business and technology at RX Africa.“As the new home for AATF and now FMA, the Gallagher Convention Centre is a great venue for the foot traffic we’re expecting.

With an abundance of opportunities, these shows offer a window to the future, featuring the finest products and suppliers.”Growth of manufacturing in Africa is outpacing global statistics, with business to-business spend on manufacturing in Africa estimated to reach over $666,3bn by 2030. This impressive figure is $200bn more than it was in 2015. “The leading players in manufacturing on the African continent will be represented at the shows this year,” adds Woods.New product categories and show innovations to be revealed at AATF2023This year’s theme ‘For Africa from Africa’ covers all things automation and technology, from the fundamental transformation of the electricity sector to the future of water supply, along with placing Africa at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and bridging the gap between manufacturing and the transport sector.FMA2023 aims to connect businesses across the continentThe only trade show in Africa focusing on the full manufacturing value chain for the African continent, FMA2023 serves as a platform for companies to introduce new innovations to strategic decision makers from Africa.“We look forward to welcoming visitors and exhibitors to both shows.
