Directed by Melina Matsoukas and shot by academy award nominated cinematographer Bradford Young, the film is a celebratory exploration of an island that’s distinct style, rhythm, and soul has reverberated across the globe.“Early Levi’s spots were some of the pieces that actually inspired me to pursue commercial filmmaking. It is an honour to now be part of their cinematic legacy.“I always gravitate toward brands and creatives who lean into authentic storytelling and, with this piece, we were able to pay homage to a small but powerful piece of history.“Droga5 have been incredible partners who are willing to push the idea of commerciality and I love that courage. We are cut from the same cloth in that way,”  says Matsoukas.Fair exchangeThe second film, Fair exchange, tells the story of a beloved family bellcow and the son who swapped the beast for a pair of 501 Jeans, much to his family's dismay.Directed by Martin de Thurah and shot by cinematographer Kasper Tuxen, a cold Georgian winter is the backdrop to a film that explores 501 jeans as a beacon for something bigger – a dream.Legends never dieThe third film, Legends never die, tells the true story of one devoted Levi’s wearer who requested to be buried in his 501 jeans – a final wish that many people have relayed to the brand over the years.This specific fan asked all funeral attendees to wear their 501 jeans too.Also directed by de Thurah, the film is a beautiful meditation on the type of collective love that would inspire a group of people to show up in denim for a beloved family member and friend. It is a celebration of humanity and the inextricable connection between a man who truly lived in his Levi’s  501 jeans.“I have done some of my best work over the years with Droga5, and I was intrigued by the challenge to create little stories in a mini format together.“Levi's is an iconic brand and being able to celebrate the 150th anniversary alongside my favourite people was a wonderful opportunity," says de Thurah.Still being written“For 150 years, we’ve bore witness to the greatest story unfolding.

And 150 years on, The greatest story ever worn is still being written.”Everyone’s storyMore than a pair of jeans, they are not just one person’s story, but everyone’s story.
