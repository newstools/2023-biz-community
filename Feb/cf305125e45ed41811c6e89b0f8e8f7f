Just like a person needs a budget and spending plan, the government needs one too.This helps them allocate the income they receive from taxes to the areas they need to spend on, like education, healthcare, and infrastructure to mention just a few sectors. The biggest implication that the budget has on the general public is the change in personal income tax, fuel levies and sin taxes.“In light of the current economic environment, it has become increasingly important for consumers to pay special attention to the National Budget Speech, as key decisions made by the Minister will have an impact on their personal financial situation and potential wealth creation,” says Ester Ochse, product head at FNB Integrated Advice.




The government does a budget on an annual basis, and as a consumer, it is critical to reassess your current spending and behaviour. It is also important to understand where your money is going and if you are spending on the things that are important to you. If you don’t know how, it is recommended that you educate yourself which will help you plan for the future, pay off existing debt or even save for specific goals you want to accomplish this year.The below are key elements to consider from the speech:The impact to consumers' budget, including.Personal income tax: Changes to personal income tax might reduce or increase the amount you receive on a monthly basis from your salary.Taxes: Sin Tax imposed on liquor, tobacco and fuel will have a big effect depending on how much of your budget is spent on these items.Increase in Tax Free Savings Account limit to allow for more saving, if the limit is increased.Vat If there is an increase or decrease in Vat, then what you will pay for goods and services will increase or decrease.Dividend tax: This will potentially impact the amount of net dividend income in the investors' hands if increased or decreased.Capital Gains tax: This will affect the net amount received if you sell something of a capital nature such as shares and property.Estate Duty: If the estate duty rebate is increased or decreased and/or the estate duty is increased or decreased, this could potentially affect the liquidity in one’s estate.Ochse explains that it’s also a good time to keep an eye on your personal finances and budgeting strategy.
