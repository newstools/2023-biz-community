Testament to this is the two new clients we welcomed in our Mitchells Plain site during the last quarter of the year.”“We are creating new roles across Johannesburg, Pretoria, and Cape Town in the coming months as we look to bring even more great people into the business.“We would like to thank the seven new partnerships and the growth from existing clients that continue to trust us with their brands, those partnerships have ultimately led to the creation of so many new careers and opportunities. It’s a hugely exciting time for us as we continue to create an exceptional reputation across several sectors in South Africa.”Sigma Connected South Africa, part of the Sigma Connected Group, launched in July 2022 to solely serve the domestic market.
