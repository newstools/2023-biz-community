It’s genuinely inspiring,” says Holmes.#BizTrends2023: 5 reasons to look forward to PR in the year aheadBy Dustin Chick 20 Jan 2023Holmes singled out a new category that focuses on a different timely issue each year.“This year’s issue was Ukraine, not surprisingly. In the end we could not select just one winner from among all of the campaigns that countered Russian disinformation or provided support to Ukrainian refugees and we ended up presenting three Sabres in this category. The work was simply too good not to recognise.”The annual awards ceremony for the Innovation Sabres will take place during the day of PRovoke Media’s EMEA Summit on 23 March in Frankfurt, ahead of the evening’s Sabre Awards dinner.Both presentations and the conference will take place at Gesellschaftshaus Palmengarten, one of the city’s most elegant and historic venues.The EMEA Summit will focus on the concept of “Mission: Possible,” a theme that captures both the importance of corporate citizenship, and the value it adds to the lives of their stakeholders, but also the elevated possibilities for the future of public relations in a world where trust, credibility and reputation are all at a premium.A complete list of EMEA SABRE finalists is here.
