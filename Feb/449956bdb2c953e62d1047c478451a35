Kia is ranked the number one mass-market brand in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study (VDS) for the third consecutive year after owners reported the fewest issues after three years. Adding to this substantial aware are three segment wins for the Forte (Compact Car), Optima (Midsize Car) and Sportage (Compact SUV). This latest achievement continues to strengthen Kia’s reputation for dependability and reliability.The industry-wide study examines problems experienced during the past 12 months by original owners of three-year old vehicles. The study covers 184 specific problem areas across nine major vehicle categories: climate driving assistance, driving experience, exterior, features/controls/displays, infotainment, interior, powertrain and seats. Overall dependability is determined by the number of problems experienced per 100 vehicles (PP100). Thus, a lower score reflects a higher level of reliability.The study was comprised of 30,062 completed surveys and examined how 2020 model-year vehicles are currently performing in terms of quality, component replacement and appeal. Overall, the industry average was reported at 186 problems per 100 (PP100), an improvement of 6 PP100 from 2022, while Kia ranked highest across mass-market brands with 152 PP100 and is also the only brand within the Hyundai Motor Group to boast three segment awards for the Kia Forte, Kia Optima and Kia Sportage.
