We are a station with our own, original flavour – elevating, evolving and boldly owning our originality, while proudly representing our community of listeners through music, content and activities that inform, entertain, educate, engage, connect, inspire, uplift and empower people across Cape Town.”Exciting chapterThese core values, purpose and tagline underpin Good Hope FM’s new logo, a unique, distinctive monogram which combines the G for ‘Good’ and H for ‘Hope’ into an impactful, circular design – one that will be turned into a viewfinder in some of the station’s visual elements, placing the very community it celebrates at the heart of the brand, capturing the rhythm and originality of the city and community.




Sebola added: “In addition, the untamed and unapologetic colour palette showcases Good Hope FM as the authentic, aspirational and contemporary lifestyle platform, that not only bravely represents its audience, but inspires people far beyond the station itself.”Mostert concluded, “this is an exciting new chapter for Good Hope FM, but it’s about more than just changing the look and feel, it’s refreshing and stepping up every element of our game and bettering our offering to listeners and clients even further by reminding us all who we are and the massive impact we make. It’s a conviction that says ‘No one can do it quite like we can. No one gets the beat quite like we do. Because no one does originality quite like an original’.”In celebrating its new look with listeners, Good Hope FM will be hosting a Cape Town’s Original party on Friday, 17 February from 9pm, with a live broadcast from Hanover Street nightclub at Grand West. The event will feature Twinz Spin’s Jade and Shad, Dr Jules and Jason Spikes.#WorldRadioDay: Radio is still kingBy Bathulisile Shongwe 6 hours ago
