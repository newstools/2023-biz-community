The main objective was to share current destination management best practices, giving advice on how to structure a successful organisation and ecosystem that supports sustainable travel.




Dawber adds: "A huge congratulations to We Are Victoria Falls for bringing their vision to life as this is no small feat, and we are looking forward to collaboratively exploring ways to position and uplift tourism within an African context, by developing ways to inspire travel between our two destinations and then share any learnings and successes with the rest of the continent."
