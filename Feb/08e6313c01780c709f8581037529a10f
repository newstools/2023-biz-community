Overall sales grew 6.1%. Over 10 months ended 25 December, group sales increased by 9.3%.Load shedding impact on turnover"The group has more recently had to contend with a significantly more difficult trading environment, with unprecedented load shedding and a further downturn in the economy," the retailer said.




"Inevitably, load shedding has disrupted customers, with some impact on turnover. Of greater consequence, however, are the substantial unplanned costs incurred in running localised power generation for stores."Pick n Pay said it spent an additional R346m year-on-year on diesel to run generators in the first 10 months of its financial year and is currently on a run rate of approximately R60m per month.Black Friday, holiday sales spur demand at ShopriteBy Nqobile Dludla 31 Jan 2023The group previously guided the market to expect broadly flat annual earnings and said in October that external headwinds, including power cuts, would have an additional impact on its results, which it will announce in May."There has been a further escalation in load shedding since then, resulting in the additional cost pressure," it said.Its bigger rival Shoprite reported a 16.8% jump in half-year sales.
