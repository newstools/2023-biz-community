This includes keeping track of customer engagement, potential leads, workflow, and tasks assigned to individual team members.Therefore, a good CRM system allows all the elements of a business to be brought into one central place, allowing managers to understand their business’s day-to-day procedures, to track the activities of sales teams and the status of customer relationships. These are all extremely powerful business intelligence indicators and metrics, which can be used to drive an organisational ‘fitter’ as well as a more successful business – exemplifying the old adage that ‘knowledge is power’.Boosting the elite sales team leaderMaximizer’s recently launched Sales Leader Edition is a CRM solution ‘on steroids’, which has specifically been designed for elite sales people and the elite sales team leader – providing great insights and allowing for assessment and coaching of the sales team to achieve sustainable success.With Sales Leader Edition, sales leaders do not have to wait until a sales report arrives to find out how the team has performed.
