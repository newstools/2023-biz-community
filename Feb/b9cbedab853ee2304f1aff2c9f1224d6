It also took the brunt of rolling power cuts in the country that curtailed its production. As a result, it has sought ways to diversify.




Last week it agreed to buy a 85% stake in Ensham coal mine in Australia from Japan's Idemitsu Kosan Co for $240m.Ndlovu said the company will keep seeking opportunities to buy coal or other bulk commodities, but it is less keen to join the race for battery metals such as copper and cobalt.He said funding for coal project acquisitions should not be difficult for the company given the prospects of returns."Where there are attractive returns there is always going to be funding," he said.
