This is achieved by analyzing continuous behavioral data, leveraging AI, and understanding the changing needs of customers, market impacts and other previously non-considered risks.This approach allows banks to better understand their customers and offer risk relevant financial products at each stage of their lives or moments in life.

Failing to offer these services could result in a loss of customers and a decline in revenue.Using AI technologies to understand a customer's real-time needs, progressive wants, and goals supports the development of personalised financial services.The pandemic has shown that a customer's financial situation can change rapidly. A high-income private banking customer can suddenly become a low-income customer.Banks need to have a comprehensive understanding of their customers' needs to respond to these ever-changing circumstances. This requires the use of continuous behavioral data and effective AI technologies.Banks that invest in personalised financial services, leveraging AI, will have a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers, as well as increasing their profitability.Dynamic segmentation is necessary if banks want to keep their customer relationships and value at the heart of everything they offer.By dividing customers into micro-segments and considering multiple factors, banks can provide a more personalised service and establish deep, valuable, and long-lasting relationships with their customers.Offering anything less than this could harm a bank's ability to retain customers and lead to a loss of revenue.The global shift towards providing real-time, personalised products and services specifically tailored to each individual, known as "segment of one" has already commenced in the banking industry.
