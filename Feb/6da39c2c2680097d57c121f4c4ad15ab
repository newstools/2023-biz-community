It encompasses everyone from hopeful youth looking to tech to create opportunities in high-unemployment markets to business people looking to bring their organisations into the 21st century, government officials looking for growth in their economies and everyone else curious about where technology is taking us all.”TechCabal will spend a significant portion of 2023 on its expansion strategy and its goal of hosting and facilitating meaningful technology conversations and events across the continent.
