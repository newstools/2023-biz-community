“With its global scale and platforms that address the entire ecosystem, Moving Walls is the ideal partner to launch these new DOOH capabilities for our region,” says Alex Tutu, regional director at Dentsu Location Services.“It is especially important that this is a tech solution that allows for flexible customisations for the different markets we are launching in,” adds Tut.Srikanth Ramachandran, founder and group CEO of Moving Walls says such a partnership is ideal to quickly scale solutions to a region where OOH remains fragmented.“Our platforms have been battle-tested in regions where even neighbouring countries have vastly different OOH ecosystems. By launching this solution with Dentsu, some of the largest advertisers across Africa will be able to transform how they run OOH advertising.”#BizTrends2023: Out of home media will shine, says Tractor Outdoor MDBy Ben Harris 9 Jan 2023Higher percentage OOH in AfricaOOH attracts a relatively higher percentage share of advertising in Africa compared to other regions, it was revealed during World Out-of-Home Forum in Africa last year.While television and radio have mostly remained fairly stable and newspapers and print have been declining, OOH spending has continued to grow. Studies suggest that OOH media account for 13% of advertising revenue in most key African markets.With about 1.3 billion people the continent is the second-largest and second-most populous after Asia. It is also home to the world’s fastest-growing middle class and a vibrant young population.This will be an attractive demographic for businesses and brands in the coming decades and the OOH canvas has continued to grow with the rise of digital screens in venues like shopping malls, airports, and residential areas.
