The project will be supported by a series of virtual and in-person panels featuring top creatives discussing all sides of the topic."The design of this project was inspired by the unexpected results of AI collaboration,” said Eduardo Gomes, head of art, Pereira O'Dell. “Our goal was to create 101 distinct pieces of art that could serve as a platform for discussing AI’s emerging role in creativity. Every aspect of this project showcases the beauty of this collaboration from the logo, the naming, the sound design, and even the data-driven architecture of each cube. The combination of human talent and technology creates a dynamic union that expands the potential of creativity.”How it worksOne hundred and one creatives, designers, filmmakers, and creative technologists from around the world, identified by The One Club’s International Board of Directors and Pereira O’Dell, represent the “101” in the project name, while an AI image generator serves as the “+1”.




Participating designers were asked to come up with a prompt, feed it into an AI image generator such as Midjourney, DALL-E 2, or Stable Diffusion, then take the resulting image and evolve it however they choose: by a little, or a lot, by hand or using digital tools.The final artwork is showcased on ADC101+1 Expo as an immersive interactive digital experience viewable on computers, mobile and VR headsets, complete with background information about each designer’s prompt, their creative process, and personal perspective on using the AI tools. Each designer’s work and background is housed in its own cube – in homage to the prestigious ADC Cube award – that’s entirely generated by AI.Brief videos feature designers discussing their inspiration, how the collaboration with AI differed from how they normally create, and at what point in this process they felt the artwork become theirs. Excerpts from the videos will be compiled into a short film to be screened at an ADC101+1 Expo panel event during Creative Week in May.One Club Global Creative Rankings announced18 Jan 2023The virtual exhibition was developed by lili Studios, a leader in online live event experiences based in Los Angeles, Hamburg and Lisbon whose portfolio includes work for Lady Gaga, Cirque du Soleil, Billie Eilish, Apple Music, Amazon, and others."We wanted to explore architecture at the intersection of data and human interaction in a world without physics and endless opportunity." says Maik Käehler, co-founder and chief creative officer at lili Studios. "The experience is designed by architects and data. All spaces are the calculated result of the name and the country of each artist. The design is completely driven by data, but it still creates a coherent architectural vision – one that is mathematically rational and unstable at the same time. That was the most interesting to us.”“ADC has been a leading creative organization for more than a century by remaining at the forefront of creative trends and issues,” said Kevin Swanepoel, CEO, The One Club for Creativity. “With ADC101+1 Expo, we continue in that role to engage the global creative community on the subject of AI, and serve as a forum for the important conversation on its uses and industry impact, both positive and negative.”ADC101+1 Expo launches with participation of the first group designers, with more added in coming months.The initial group represents 13 countries and regions: Argentina (Bruno Acanfora, Federico Guiraldes, Javier Lourenco), Australia (Mache [Simon Harsent and Gary Jacques]); China (Fish Ho, Dave Holland, Kevin Lunsong, Saidah), Finland (Sanni Wessman), Hong Kong (Isabel Tong, Justin Wong), India (Tapan Aslot, Pavithra Dikshit, Vishnu M Nair), Japan (Yusuke Koyanagi, Takao Muzumoto, Yoshihiro Yagi), Netherlands (David Bastian Fernández Izarraulde, Ally Behr, Alexandre Gellard, Mischa Loppies), Portugal (Serafim Mendes), South Africa (Fumani Khumalo, Nomonde Mtetwa), South Korea (Euiyoung Gloria Song), Spain (Ana Perez Lopez), and US (Magnus Atom, Jason Naylor, Paul Trillo).Type Directors Club to host Latin American typography conference6 Jan 2023The first ADC101+1 Expo virtual panel to discuss the opportunities and challenges around AI and the creative industry will take place on 28 February 2023, 12pm to 1pm.
