Not only has it amassed benefits for the conservation community, but it has offered a lifeline to the youth in the communities that border our national parks. Multi-sector partnerships are critical, and will continue to play a key role in sustaining tourism and our overall economy,” said Mahlalela.Where it all startedIn 2019, the department entered into a three-year agreement with SanParks to implement the Tourism Monitors Programme. Learners were placed at all national parks in South Africa, including the Kruger National Park (KNP), to gain theoretical and workplace training.“Through this collaboration, we have invested in the youth who will safeguard our natural resources for the benefit of generations to come. Out of the 259 youth who enrolled for the Tourism Monitors programme, SanParks has employed 130 at its 21 national parks,” said the KNP managing executive, Oscar Mthimkhulu.“We are extremely proud of our contribution to youth empowerment, but mostly in our efforts to usher in a new understanding on the importance of conservation, and the overall functioning of our national parks,” added Mthimkhulu.Graduates of the Tourism Monitors Programme took an opportunity to share their learnership experience with guests and thanked both entities for initiating the programme.Thinking aheadShedron Mukhumo said the programme taught her a lot about the importance of conserving and preserving our natural resources for future generations. “It has also opened my eyes to a variety of opportunities that I didn’t know existed in tourism. I’m currently a SanParks research assistant and I am proud of playing a critical role in conversing our natural resources.”Prudence Vuyisile added: “Through the Tourism Monitors Programme, I have gained experience in conservation practices and a knowledge of supply-chain management practices. The programme has given me hope and inspired me to further my studies. I’m currently on a fixed-term contract with SanParks as a debtor’s clerk.”
