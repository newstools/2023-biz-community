It means consolidating existing investments and assets involving business resources – such as data, documents, databases, applications, platforms networks, and systems, as well as security for these business-critical resources – by reducing duplicate and redundant solutions, and leveraging technologies that enable consolidation. It also means ensuring that future investments are delivering maximum return on investment.The ability to do more with less requires a full understanding of current assets and investments, how the business is leveraging these to drive growth, and whether the technology investments in place are being used appropriately in terms of security, governance and compliance. It is critical to ensure that digital solutions meet local compliance and regulatory requirements.Driving innovation with solutions that enable rapid development with fewer resourcesThe current socio-economic landscape necessitates leveraging the assets and investments businesses already have in place, but it also requires building on that foundation by innovating and reimagining ways of doing business. For more and more businesses, that means investing in cloud-powered technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and machine learning.
