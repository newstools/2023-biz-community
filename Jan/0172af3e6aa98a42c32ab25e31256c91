Following a couple of years of online judging, it’s the first time that we’ve ever judged in-person both locally and regionally, and the standards our juries have set this year truly celebrate only the very best creative work.”Emma Wilkie, awards director of The Immortal Awards, comments: “Our simple entry process of only one entry, no categories, per ad/campaign allows the juries at local, regional, and global stages to judge based purely on what creative ideas and executions will stand the test of time when awarding Immortals. Huge congratulations to our very well deserved four Immortal and nine commendation winners who have set an incredibly high creative bar for the year ahead and beyond.”The full list of winners for The Immortal Awards 2022:Immortal: Apple iPhone 13 Pro - Hollywood in Your Pocket: Detectives (submitted by O Positive) Burberry - Open Spaces (submitted by Riff Raff, Mill London and 750mph) CALM x ITV - The Last Photo (submitted by adam&eveDDB and Radford Music) Gahr WeCapital - Data Tienda (submitted by DDB Mexico)Commendation: Apple - Escape From the Office (submitted by SMUGGLER and WORK LA) Bodyform/Libresse - #periodsomnia (submitted by AMV BBDO, Somesuch, Time Based Arts, Trim and 750mph) Call of Duty - Warzone in Paradise (submitted by 72andSunny LA) Heineken - The Night is Young (submitted by Publicis Italy via Golden Drum) Ikea - Cirkulär (submitted by Accenture Song in Denmark) Matilda Bay Brewery - Rejected Ales (submitted by Howatson+Company) Penguin Random House - The Unburnable Book (submitted by Rethink) Royal Ontario Museum - Immortal (submitted by Broken Heart Love Affair) WhatsApp - One (submitted by Company 3)
