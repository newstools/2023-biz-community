The former educator assistants were employed as part of the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative (PYEI), which was implemented as the Basic Education Employment Initiative (BEEI) across all nine provinces to reduce youth unemployment in the country.When their contracts ended, the former employees qualified to claim unemployment insurance benefits from the UIF.“Due to the large volume of claims anticipated and to prevent long queues at Labour Centres, the UIF team in KwaZulu-Natal met with the Provincial Department of Education in Amajuba and agreed on a consolidated approach. This included the department availing venues while the Fund confirms the compliance of the former workers in terms of their employment history, declarations, and contributions.“The UIF in KwaZulu-Natal will be rolling out the project to other parts of the province and will announce dates and details in due course via its social media platforms and the media,” the department said.
