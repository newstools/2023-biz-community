Ryan made an appearance to highlight the combined efforts by the two companies to offer an incredible experience to tens of millions of customers worldwide. “Pluto TV, the leading free streaming television service, is expanding our channel integration for LG Channels, adding over 100 channels this quarter globally,” said Ryan. Ryan concluded by stating that the two companies will continue to expand their partnership and broaden their capabilities together in 2023.A pledge to create a better futureConcluding his presentation, Cho reiterated LG’s steadfast commitment as a responsible corporate citizen to realise a sustainable future, emphasising the company’s focus to create a better future for all. Efforts include the Global IT Challenge for Youth with Disabilities (GITC) which, since 2011, has empowered more than 4,000 youth to build skills in technology with the goal to eliminate the digital divide for persons with disabilities.Cho also mentioned the company’s promise to increase the accessibility of LG’s products and services to ensure easy use by the disabled and elderly. Guided by feedback from LG’s ‘Disabled Advisory Group’ – in operation since 2021 and comprised of members with varying abilities and accessibility experts – the company is continuously introducing barrier-free products that can be conveniently used by all. In South Korea, the company has various measures in place to strengthen accessibility, such as developing product manuals that incorporate audio and sign language guides, distributing braille stickers for appliances and operating sign language counseling centres.Aligned with this, the CEO announced the four finalists of the inaugural Life's Good Award, an innovation challenge set up by the company to promote its Life’s Good vision and empower innovators eager to make a positive impact on people’s lives and the planet. The finalists – Day1Lab, Dot Inc., NONA Desalination and SOLUTUM – will receive LG’s support to help fine-tune and launch their inventive solutions to create a better life for all.
