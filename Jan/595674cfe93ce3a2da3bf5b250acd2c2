What we are doing now is bringing Southern Africa it's own on-soil cloud-hosted version. Having technology customised to meet the growing demand from a broad segment of South African customers and plugging directly into BankServ, Visa, and Mastercard locally has been warmly welcomed by existing Southern African clients and has already secured significant interest from potential clients in the retail, banking, fintech and telco space.
