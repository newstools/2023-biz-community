Getting your best smile is as easy as ABC, and you don’t actually need to have invasive surgery.“It’s crazy in 2023 that people would still consider drilling away their own natural enamel to correct a cosmetic issue with crowns or veneers when modern dentistry offers so much more. It’s like getting knee replacement when physiotherapy would do just as well.” - Dr. Clifford YudelmanOur ABC approachABC is a combination of minimally invasive treatments that result in a great outcome. You can pick and choose whichever combination suits your needs best. It includes:A – Align the anterior (front) teeth. We use Invisalign Clear AlignersB – Bleaching, otherwise known as teeth whitening.C – Composite bonding to correct any wear or variations in size, shape or colour of the newly aligned teeth.The ABC approach is a progressive strategy to smile design allowing for a minimally invasive treatment plan to be used and, at the same time, meeting the needs of the patient’s aesthetic demands. This replaces the need for crowns or veneers, which requires drilling away good enamel from your teeth.ContactWebsite: [[http://optismile.co.zCall 087 702 6886WhatsApp 071 1400 39About OptiSmileOptiSmile proudly offers its patients the latest dental technology and procedures.
