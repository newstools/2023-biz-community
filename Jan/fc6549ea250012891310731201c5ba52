It truly adds another layer of convenience and benefits to the Discovery Bank app and elevates it as a mobile-first experience across banking, saving, travelling, and paying for health and other lifestyle services."The latest version of the Discovery Bank app allows clients to find a flight in just a few taps and gives access to brilliant travel features. Clients can now:




• Browse all local and international flights• Select, filter and sort search results by airline, cabin class, fare type, stops, and times• See discounts automatically applied on all partner airlines• Pay seamlessly from Discovery Bank cards, accounts, or with Discovery Miles• Manage traveller identification information• View and share travel itineraries that automatically update in real-time."When we introduced the Vitality Travel Platform, the industry was still feeling the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. But we knew the valuable role travel has played in improving and rewarding healthy client behaviour. We are excited about future developments of Vitality Travel, which operates off the Discovery Bank operating system. We’re not only giving clients the best travel-discount rewards but have set out to deliver the best travel experiences from start to finish – and this is a major step forward to achieving this goal."
