I want to commend the WCCN staff, both academic and support staff, for working very hard to ensure that we have obtained this accreditation and we can proudly say we are a higher education institution,” says Tendani Mabuda, director of the Western Cape Nursing College.“One of my priorities is to strengthen the healthcare system so that we can provide the best healthcare to our communities. Through our provincial nursing strategy, we have identified advanced measures to overcome any possible shortage of staff and to actively fill gaps in the system. The WCCN plays a key role in strengthening our complement of specialist trained nurses,” says Mbombo.The health department has made a huge investment towards training of nurses in the province. Several interventions to increase the supply of nurses were implemented such as establishing an integrated nurse-training framework, a co-ordinated clinical nurse-training platform and obtaining Sanc accreditation of additional nursing programmes and clinical placement sites.According to Mabuda, the WCCN is focusing on expanding its programme-offering in order to align with the departmental nursing strategy to fill gaps in the system. “We are awaiting the SAQA ID for the advanced diploma in midwifery (GN 1497), as well as Che accreditation for the postgraduate programmes in peri-operative nursing, mental health nursing, critical care adult, trauma and emergency, orthopaedics, primary care nursing, and midwifery."The WCCN is also in the process of submitting the curriculum for forensic nursing to Sanc."
