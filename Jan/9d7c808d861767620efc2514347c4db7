I can’t wait to see what this year’s winners will show, since it will certainly reveal where the discipline is headed.”This year’s Ascenders branding and award are designed by Anil Aykin, graphic designer at Barnbrook Design in London and member of the TDC Advisory Board. The design depicts the “ascending” creatives by embracing the idea of growth and invasion, with the journey demonstrated by visual metaphors of steps toward further growth and expansion.
