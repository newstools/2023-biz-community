Taking place at the Stias Wallenberg Research Centre in Marais Rd in Stellenbosch this week (16-20 January 2023), the initiative brings together both distinguished and young scholars from all over the world to debate some of the world's most pressing issues in the field of international law, policy and economics.The aim of the GSA is to invest in the next generation of scholars by placing them in conversation with their global peers, thereby strengthening their ability to think in new ways about global issues that the world faces – ranging from structural poverty, human rights, inequality and migration to international economic and legal policies, environmental sustainability and global security.The event will see participants engaging in writing workshops and present their research-in-progress to be debated by their local and international peers in a round-table format. Leading experts will also participate by presenting opening lectures or by facilitating the round-table discussions.Topics that will be debated include social justice; land reform, constitution and transformation; pathways to economic development and justice; and human rights obligations under South Africa's domestic refugee law."We expect to see a wave of new ideas and multidisciplinary research as a result of this unique platform in which some of the world's promising young researchers can engage, explore new ideas, and network at both an individual and institutional level," says Professor Nicola Smit, Dean of the Faculty of Law, who collaborated closely with IGLP Director Professor David Kennedy (see info) and SU International in bringing the Academy to Stellenbosch.High-profile speakers and plenary sessions include: David Kennedy (Harvard Law School) and Nicola Smit (SU Faculty of Law): plenary sessions.
