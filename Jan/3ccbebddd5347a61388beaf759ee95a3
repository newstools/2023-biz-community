"And, I'm very excited about the prospects. Every successful enterprise builds on the shoulders of giants, but also relies on developing new ideas. These changes take us down that road.

It also marked the birth of the country's Cap Classique category.The latest harvest at Simonsig got underway last week, and there is much excitement around the condition of the fruit, Malan says. "This was certainly the earliest start of the harvest for us, as far as I can remember," says Malan, who adds that a very dry, but healthy growing season promises excellent quality.
