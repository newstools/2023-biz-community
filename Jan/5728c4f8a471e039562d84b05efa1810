LG QuadWash Pro DishwasherFor a quick and easy after-meal tidy up, LG QuadWash Pro dishwasher can get dish and tableware spotlessly clean in just one hour. QuadWash Pro provides enhanced cleaning power, using high-pressure jets of water to spray dishes from multiple angles while simultaneously soaking them with over one million microbubbles to help break down stubborn food residue. LG’s advanced dishwasher also employs Dynamic Heat Dry™ technology, which circulates hot air throughout the dishwashing compartment for a faster drying performance and table-ready dishes right off the rack. And for the finishing touch, LG’s exclusive TrueSteam® helps to reduce the occurrence of water spots to leave every dish, glass and spoon, sparkling clean.1LG InstaView Combination Double Wall OvenAdding a touch of class to the kitchen, the LG InstaView Combination Double Wall Oven features a clean, sophisticated design that incorporates LG’s exclusive ‘knock twice’ InstaView door – which lets users see how their dish is progressing without disturbing the cooking temperature.

And for those who love the taste and texture of fried food, Air Fry mode produces crispy, flavorful treats with less fat, and no preheating required.LG InstaView Electric Double Slide-in RangeIdeal for big families or those who like to entertain, the LG InstaView Electric Double Slide-in Range has a large capacity that makes it possible to cook multiple dishes at once.
