The setting up of a fertiliser production plant is "a priority" in Madagascar's Emergence Plan, he said.Some 80% of Malagasy people depend on 31% of Madagascar's 8 million-hectare arable lands, he said.OCP said in October it would allocate 4 million tonnes of fertilisers for the African market next year, double its sales on the continent in 2021.Previously, in July, it said it was offering 180,000 tonnes of soil nutrients in aid and 370,000 tonnes at a discount to help African states cope with surging prices.
