His departure from the group comes as Spar faces various allegations of fraud, fictitious loans and racial bias.As News24 reported in December, fraud charges were filed against Spar senior executives amid allegations that the grocer falsely claimed in 2019 it was owed money in order to gain control over certain supermarkets.
