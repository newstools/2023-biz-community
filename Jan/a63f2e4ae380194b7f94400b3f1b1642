Not only will it inform the way the world sees the South African music industry, it will also deliver unique insights into future trends, up-and-coming artists to look out for, and the place global music has to play as a category that defies definition.”Notes and ideas from each panellist will be shared in a Global Music Panel Discussion Report. The discussion, which will be live streamed on @RecordingAcademy YouTube, will take place on Tuesday, 31 January at 21h00 CAT (11h00 CET).Says fellow panellist and business partner Sibo Mhlungu of IMG Africa; “I’m humbled by the success Bantwini has achieved and by the role he’s playing in bringing local music to the global stage. And, of course, I want to see him holding his very own Grammy up high.”
