Tellingly, the local Allergy Care market has experienced astounding growth in recent years, having achieved a CARG of 11.9% between 2016 and 2021.Globally, greater numbers of consumers are experiencing allergic rhinitis and hay fever symptoms, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimating that allergic rhinitis affects between 10% and 30% of the global adult population, and up to 40% of children. As a result, key market players are launching new and innovative products that treat allergic rhinitis and hay fever symptoms, in order to cater to this robust and growing consumer demand. For example, Altamira Therapeutics recently launched Bentrio Nasal Spray in the United States (US). This product is formulated to specifically treat symptoms of allergic rhinitis, triggered by inhaling airborne allergens, through its key ingredient of the clay mineral, bentonite. Moreover, Théa Pharmaceuticals recently announced that the company was launching a new eye spray, namely Zaspray, which assists in the relief of dry eye symptoms caused by hay fever and other allergic conditions.Similarly, the South African market is also experiencing growth caused by the increasing prevalence of allergic rhinitis, with the Chief Executive of the Allergy Foundation of South Africa, Professor Mike Levin, estimating that allergic rhinitis affects up to half the population. As such, this high local prevalence of allergic rhinitis has also stimulated advancements in the local industry, as key players launch new products targeted at treating allergic rhinitis and hay fever, and expand their existing product lines, by offering consumers novel formats of these products.As an illustration of this local advancement, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited recently launched Ryaltris® nasal spray for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in the South African market. This product offers consumers a first-of-its-kind combination inhaler treatment, that contains an antihistamine and a steroid, designed for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis. This nasal spray offers allergic rhinitis sufferers a new and innovative way to treat the inconvenient symptoms associated with this allergic condition.Additionally, Aspen Pharmacare recently announced that it was expanding its Allergy Care range, BETADEXAMINE, with the launch of a new product format, BETADEXAMINE Tablets. This product is specifically formulated for the treatment of acute allergic rhinitis, that is not responsive to conventional therapy, thereby also working to meet the growing consumer demand for effective allergic rhinitis amongst South African consumers.The South African Allergy Care Industry Landscape Report 2022 (89 pages) provides a dynamic synthesis of industry research, examining the local and global Allergy Care industry (including the impact of Covid-19) from a uniquely holistic perspective, with detailed insights into the entire value chain – market sizes and forecasts, industry trends, latest innovation and technology, key drivers and challenges; as well as manufacturing, distribution, retailer, and pricing analysis.Some key questions the report will help you to answer: What are the key market dynamics of the global and South African Allergy Care industry?
