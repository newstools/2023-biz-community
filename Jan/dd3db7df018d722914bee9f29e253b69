He elaborates, “The outcomes of these partnerships are two-fold: the SMEs gain market access, world-class mentorship from industry experts, opportunities to secure investment and/or preferential loans, as well as invaluable exposure to industry leaders. Big business gains through access to cutting-edge innovation in their local supply chains and optimising their BBBEE scorecard.”Call for collaboration to build a competitive SA furniture industry20 Oct 2022The accelerator is facilitated through industrial manufacturing clusters, representing various sectors and follows a process of applications i.e. short-listing of applicants, pitch development support, Dragons’ Den event, business case development and mentorship.eThekwini Municipality is a key sponsor of the accelerator under the guidance of Ravesha Govender, who says, “High potential SMEs are identified through the application and screening processes and are then invited to a 'Capacity Building' workshop. Here, SME participants develop their business cases in preparation for the Dragons’ Den event under the guidance of industry specialists.“At the Dragons’ Den, participants present their business cases to the ‘Dragons’ who are top executives from the big businesses in each sector, eager to find new high potential, local suppliers.
