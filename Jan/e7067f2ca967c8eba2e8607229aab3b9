“The programme plays an important role in retaining learners beyond the formal schooling programme. Learners who are disappointed by their failure or poor performance at the end of their schooling career, are able to continue with their studies at their own pace.“They are able to register for one, two or more subjects, and write the examinations either in May/June or October/November. The face-to-face centres keep learners motivated, as they prepare for their examinations. Learners migrate within provinces, seeking job opportunities and the SCMP allows learners to continue with their studies, irrespective of the province they have relocated to,” she said.Subjects that learners can register for include: Accounting Agricultural Science Business Studies Economics English First Additional Language Geography History Mathematics Mathematic Literacy Physical Sciences Life Sciences“The programme offers face-to-face support, online support and a wide range of learning support materials. The programme facilitates the development of learning and teaching support materials (LTSMs) that is based on diagnostic reports, so as to ensure that the support materials focus on common areas of poor performance emanating from previous examinations.“The LTSMs are government-owned, printed and distributed to learners at no cost to the learner,” Motshekga said.To register for the programme online go to www.eservices.gov.za or visit any Department of Basic Education office with an ID document and statement of results.Release of matric results on track3 hours agoCommunity education and trainingThose who are older and/or those who have not had the opportunity to complete matric due to various reasons and those who do not qualify for higher education can register at Community Education and Training (CET) colleges across the country.According to the Department of Higher Education, Science and Innovation website, the colleges are supported by some 200 community learning centres.“These colleges...target post-school youth and adults who wish to raise the base for further learning, improve their skills for employability and/or progression to opportunities in the TVET colleges and university education.“In essence, community education and training...offer(s) programmes that contribute to improving community cohesion and social capital, and responsive to the geographic and sectoral needs and challenges,” the department said.The colleges offer training and academic learning opportunities, including the General Education and Training Certificate for adults (GETC), courses in computer literacy and applied agriculture.In his budget speech last year, Minister Blade Nzimande said at least R200m has been committed to support CET colleges which are critical to closing South Africa’s skills gap.“In addition to academic skills and occupational programmes already on offer, CET colleges will offer two new accredited programmes which are Entrepreneurship and Digital Skills programmes.“Nine hundred CET college lecturers will be trained in accredited training programmes.
