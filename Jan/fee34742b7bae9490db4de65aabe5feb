He goes on to say that where vine irrigation is required, a continuous supply of water is required. Failure to do so can have seriousconsequences for the quality of the grapes.While wineries are suffering from frequent power outages, Pentz notes that there are several alternative power supply options available, but the ultimate responsibility remains with Eskom.




"Eskom has to get its ducks in a row," Pentz says. "Alternative energy production, such as solar and wind energy, are viable options, but the initial investment is prohibitively expensive. That is still not the final solution, and the onus is on the national energy supplier to sustainably supply us with power.‚ÄùDespite these obstacles, the wine farm is determined to continue producing high-quality wines. "We have backup generators and other measures in place to mitigate the impact of the power outages," says Pentz. "We're also keeping a close eye on the situation and collaborating with industry leaders to find solutions to the ongoing loadsedding crisis."
