Transnet said it would issue an open tender to manufacturers in the few next weeks to repair locomotives bought from CRRC. Transnet's rail services have deteriorated, in part due to a shortage of spare parts for the locomotives.The resolution of the matter was key to supporting Transnet's efforts to normalise operations, enhance services to customers, and boosting the economy, the logistics firm added.
