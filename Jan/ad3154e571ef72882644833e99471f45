“There was also an establishment of a forestry plantation by the South African Forestry Company Limited (Safcol).“The establishment of both the asbestos mine and the plantation created employment for the community and only those community members who worked for both companies and their families were allowed to reside on the farm,” the minister said.Reflections on land reform as we recover from a pandemic and a sluggish economyBy Peter Setou 24 Jan 2023Homes demolishedThe community was removed from the houses built by Safcol in 1973 and when the Komati Land Company took over from Safcol, the houses of the community members not working for Safcol were demolished.
