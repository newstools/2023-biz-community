Notably, the platform can also source products the retailer itself doesn't stock.The team receives orders uploaded to the track and trace system and can either source requests in-house using Builders vendors or source products from external vendors if the retailer doesn't stock that specific item.




“In the last two years we have seen a surge in South Africans spending more time at home online to search for solutions to fix or improve their homes.  Builders has always had the 'we will find it for you' philosophy although there was not a dedicated way to ensure that we do deliver on these requests or any way to track requests and follow up on the leads. The Product Finder Tool means that we can now deliver on this in a seamless and efficient manner”, says Nicole le Roux, senior manager digital sales, Builders.#BizTrends2023: Greater online retail expectations and a changing basket at checkoutBy Frederik Zietsman 9 Jan 2023According to a recent Statista report looking into South Africa’s mobile internet user penetration 2018-2027, in 2022, 78.6% of the South African population accessed the internet via mobile device.
