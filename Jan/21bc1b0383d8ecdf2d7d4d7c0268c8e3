“As the media landscape becomes more varied and complicated, Nielsen is committed to working with the industry to bring clarity and simplicity to media buying and selling through Nielsen One.“By combining the scale of big data and granular insights from our people-based panel, Nielsen One provides comprehensive, representative measurement of ads and content for our clients to transact with confidence,” adds Rao.Reach and frequency deduplicatedFor the first time, advertisers, brands and publishers will be able to understand reach and frequency, deduplicated across linear TV, connected TV, desktop, and mobile.Nielsen One Ads will allow publishers to show the strength of their platforms and buyers of media to find the most efficient and effective places to advertise to reach the right audiences.In addition to its standard metrics across platforms, Nielsen One Ads will introduce impact data for more granular linear television measurement, calculating audiences at the second level rather than today’s industry standard of minute level audiences.This will provide the industry with greater comparably across television and digital platforms.Nielsen brings scale for open web digital measurement to SA10 Aug 2022Always on metrics for digital campaigns and insightsNielsen One Ads will also deliver “always on” metrics for digital campaigns and insights.In addition, Nielsen One’s proprietary ID system will be leveraged as well as data from Nielsen’s panels. Further, direct publisher integrations, across walled-gardens will provide an understanding of true persons-level campaign impressions.In 2023 Nielsen One Ads will also evolve to include advanced audience and outcomes measurement to support a campaign from end-to-end, providing an unparalleled view of the audience at each step of the media journey: from the audience who saw an ad campaign, to how the campaign was delivered to niche audiences, and the actions those audiences took as a result of seeing the campaign. Nielsen One Content AlphaIn addition to Nielsen ONE Ads, Nielsen recently introduced Nielsen One Content Alpha which will be available this year, which provides cross-platform, deduplicated, and syndicated content metrics across devices, delivering a clearly contextualized view of aggregated programme performance across distribution platforms.Together, Nielsen One Ads and Content will bridge current measurement capabilities, both linear and digital, into a single system.Ultimately, Nielsen One will allow advertisers and publishers to plan and transact using a single metric across linear and digital that is reliable, independent and standardised across the industry.
