As South Africa's rail service deteriorated, some coal miners last year opted to truck their product to port instead.




RBCT chief executive Alan Waller told a media briefing that a 12-day strike at Transnet in October and a derailment of 97 wagons of a train that blocked the coal line for 10 days in November had stopped the export of an estimated 5 million tonnes from the terminal.The terminal has a target to export 60 million tonnes in 2023, Waller added.Transnet posts profit in half year consolidated financial results28 Dec 2022Disruptions to Transnet's freight rail servicesPoor maintenance, a lack of spare parts for locomotives, and massive copper cable theft have disrupted state logistics firm Transnet's freight rail services, causing coal and iron ore exports to fall in recent years.Asia's share of RBCT's coal exports fell in 2022, with 31.7 million tonnes of coal going to the region, down from 50.7 million tonnes the previous year. Some 15.51 million tonnes went to India, down from 24.1 million tonnes in 2021.
