Across languages, that common alliteration connects the cultures of the continent, serving as a thread amongst very diverse people.Connection to historyTDC, part of The One Club for Creativity, will bring the dynamic range and rhythm of Latin American culture as it manifests visually, and typographically. The conference will look at specific design movements and styles that are prevalent in Latin America, explore how the connection to history and heritage manifests among Latin American diaspora, and showcase for the rest of the world on how Latin American typography and design exists and innovates.Two SA creatives on ADC 102nd Annual Awards jury6 Dec 2022The conference lineup was curated by Sol Matas, Berlin-based independent type designer originally from Argentina and a member of the TDC Advisory Board, and Laura Scofield, a Brazilian-born, New York-based designer, strategist, and educator who currently serves as senior design manager at The Atlantic Re:think.

This will be a rare opportunity to celebrate the abundance it has to offer.”Old world and newThe conference will cover a range of topics, from amateur street typography to agency boardrooms.
