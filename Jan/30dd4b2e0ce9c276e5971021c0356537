This enables us to provide direct support to improve entrepreneurial opportunities equally, and to provide further springboards forinvestment-ready female-founded businesses in South Africa,” says Catherine Young, partner at Grindstone.




Female founders will undergo detailed assessments and analyses of their companies, followed by carefully structured interventions, as needed. Interventions include business strategy; go-to-market planning; funding readiness and networking; and expert business coaching, including mentorship and advice from Grindstone Alumni companies that have successfully scaled or exited their businesses.Previous alumni of Grindstone’s programmes include on-demand grocery delivery provider OneCart, which exited to Massmart; Luxity; delivery management platform Loop; and visitor management startup Wizzpass, which exited to FM:Systems in 2021.
